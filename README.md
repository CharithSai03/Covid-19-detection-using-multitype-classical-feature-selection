# Covid-19-detection-using-multitype-classical-feature-selection


selection
Covid-19 detection for chest CT-scans. Methodology consists of of four
principle steps-multiple feature extraction using classical techniques(i.e.,
DCT, DWT, and DRLBP), Max-Covariance Maximization approach for
fusion of all these features, optimization of features using PSO along
ELM fitness function, and finally optimized features embed in SVDD
classifier for final classification.


### Process followed
